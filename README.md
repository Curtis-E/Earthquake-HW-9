# Earthquake-HW-9

This project applies K-means clustering to U.S. Earthquake Intensity Database (1638â€“1985) using longitude and latitude to identify for more than 23,000 U.S. earthquakes. It also visualizes the cluster centers using a Voronoi diagram.

## Dataset

Dataset: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/natural-hazards/tsunamis-earthquakes-volcanoes/earthquakes/intensity-database-1638-1985 

K-means:

The K-means algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares. This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. 

Elbow plot: Helps determine the optimal number of clusters
